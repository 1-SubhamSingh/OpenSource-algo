Welcome to **Algo**, an open-source project that provides developers with algorithmic solutions and resources. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, you can contribute, learn, and grow with us! ðŸš€

## Project Overview

Algo provides a collection of well-documented algorithmic solutions written in various programming languages, covering a range of topics like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.

We aim to:
- Create an extensive library of algorithms in different languages
- Help developers learn algorithmic problem-solving
- Foster open-source contribution and collaboration

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Algorithms in multiple programming languages
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Well-structured, easy-to-understand explanations
- **Open Source Contributions**: Welcoming developers at all levels to contribute

## Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory, which can be served using any static content hosting service.

## Deployment

### Using SSH:

```bash
$ USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

### Not using SSH:

```bash
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub Pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers of all experience levels. Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.
