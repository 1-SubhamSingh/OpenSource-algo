# Graphs

Graph algorithms are essential in solving complex problems across various domains, such as computer science, networking, and artificial intelligence. Below is an overview of common graph algorithms categorized by their functionalities.

## Applications of Graphs

Graphs are versatile data structures that model relationships and connections in various domains. Here are some key applications of graphs:

1. **Social Networks**:
   - Graphs represent users as vertices and their relationships (friends, followers) as edges, enabling analysis of social dynamics and influence.

2. **Transportation and Navigation**:
   - Road networks can be modeled as graphs, where intersections are vertices and roads are edges. Algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* are used for route optimization.

3. **Network Routing**:
   - In computer networks, routers and switches are represented as nodes, and the connections between them as edges, facilitating efficient data transmission.

4. **Recommendation Systems**:
   - Graphs help in analyzing user-item interactions, enabling personalized recommendations based on collaborative filtering techniques.

5. **Web Page Ranking**:
   - The PageRank algorithm uses graph theory to rank web pages based on their link structures, determining the importance of pages in search engine results.

6. **Biological Networks**:
   - Graphs model biological systems, such as protein-protein interaction networks or metabolic pathways, aiding in the understanding of complex biological processes.

7. **Game Development**:
   - Graphs represent game maps and character movements, allowing for efficient pathfinding and AI decision-making in dynamic environments.

8. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - In software engineering, graphs model dependencies between modules or tasks, facilitating build order determination and resource allocation.

9. **Circuit Design**:
   - Electronic circuits can be represented as graphs where components are nodes and connections are edges, assisting in circuit analysis and optimization.

10. **Project Management**:
    - Graphs model tasks and their dependencies in project management (e.g., PERT charts), helping to identify critical paths and optimize scheduling.

Graphs play a crucial role in various fields, making them an essential concept in computer science and related disciplines.

## 1. Traversal Algorithms
These algorithms are used to visit all the nodes in a graph.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, useful for pathfinding and topological sorting.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ideal for shortest path finding in unweighted graphs.

## 2. Shortest Path Algorithms
These algorithms find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

### Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Computes shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a graph, allowing for negative weight edges.

### A* Search Algorithm
- Uses heuristics to efficiently find the shortest path, often used in pathfinding and graph traversal.

### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- A dynamic programming algorithm that finds shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.

## 3. Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms
These algorithms find a subset of edges that connect all vertices with the minimum total edge weight.

### Prim’s Algorithm
- Builds the minimum spanning tree by adding edges one at a time, starting from an arbitrary node.

### Kruskal’s Algorithm
- Finds the minimum spanning tree by sorting edges and adding them one by one while avoiding cycles.

## 4. Network Flow Algorithms
These algorithms deal with flow networks and finding maximum flow.

### Ford-Fulkerson Method
- Computes the maximum flow in a flow network using augmenting paths.

### Edmonds-Karp Algorithm
- An implementation of Ford-Fulkerson that uses BFS to find augmenting paths, ensuring polynomial time complexity.

## 5. Graph Connectivity Algorithms
These algorithms determine the connectivity properties of a graph.

### Tarjan’s Algorithm
- Finds strongly connected components in a directed graph using DFS.

### Kosaraju’s Algorithm
- Another method for finding strongly connected components using two passes of DFS.

## 6. Cycle Detection Algorithms
These algorithms identify cycles within graphs.

### Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs
- Uses DFS to detect cycles by tracking visited nodes and recursion stack.

### Cycle Detection in Undirected Graphs
- Uses DFS or Union-Find to detect cycles by checking for back edges.

## 7. Topological Sorting Algorithms
These algorithms provide an ordering of vertices for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

### Kahn’s Algorithm
- Uses indegrees of vertices to produce a topological sort iteratively.

### Depth-First Search Based Topological Sort
- Uses DFS to produce a topological order by finishing times of vertices.

## 8. Graph Coloring Algorithms
These algorithms assign colors to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

### Greedy Coloring Algorithm
- Assigns colors sequentially while ensuring no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

## 9. Matching Algorithms
These algorithms find matches in bipartite graphs or general graphs.

### Hopcroft-Karp Algorithm
- Efficiently finds maximum matching in bipartite graphs using BFS and DFS.

## 10. Miscellaneous Algorithms
Other notable graph algorithms include:

### Johnson’s Algorithm
- Finds all pairs shortest paths in sparse graphs using both Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithms.

### PageRank Algorithm
- An algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages based on their importance as determined by link structures.
